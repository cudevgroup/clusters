# New Cluster Guide
You want a new cluster in CDC? Great! Keep the following in mind when writing your proposal:
- There must be at least 5 CDC members who are interested in joining the cluster. A cluster can't exist without members, can it?
- There must be someone willing to lead the cluster. Bonus points if that someone is you.
- The leader must be knowledgeable to a reasonable extent (at least) in the area the cluster is to be created for. They need to be able to start and moderate discussions, and man projects.
- You may include topics of interest and project ideas to make the proposal even more awesome.
