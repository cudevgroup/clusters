# CDC clusters
Covenant University Developers Community (CDC) is divided into clusters based on specific areas of Software Development. You can join any and as many clusters as you want, provided you can keep up with participating in their discussions and projects.

Outlined below is a list of all CDC clusters:
- [Front-end](clusters/front-end.md)
- [Back-end](clusters/back-end.md)
- [UI/UX Design](clusters/ui-ux.md)
- [Machine Learning and Data Science](clusters/ml-ds.md)
- [Competitive Programming](clusters/comp-prog.md)
- [DevOps](clusters/devops.md)

> It's okay to not be familiar with or knowledgeable in the subject matter of the cluster(s) you may like to join. One of our goals as a community is to help beginners learn Software Development. We have resources to help you learn and get up to speed in any area you might be interested in. We also have mentors to guide you and answer your questions.

## New clusters
We are more than happy to start new clusters in CDC. If you want a new cluster, write a proposal using [this guide](new-cluster.md). You may also [find existing proposals made by others](https://github.com/cudevgroup/clusters/issues) and share your thoughts.
