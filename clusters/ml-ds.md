# Machine Learning and Data Science Cluster
The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday life has become increasingly popular in recent years thanks to advancements in the field, especially in a specific area known as Machine Learning (ML). ML in simple terms is **the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed**. With machine learning, computers are able to learn from data (training), similar to how humans do.

Data Science on the other hand is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

In this cluster, our discussions and projects revolve around data extraction, cleaning, analysis and visualization, understanding the mathematics behind ML algorithms, building and training ML models, and solving local problems with AI.
