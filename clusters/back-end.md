# Back-end Cluster
The back-end of a web application refers to its server side. That is, everything that communicates between a database and a browser. Back-end development involves writing code that runs on a web server. The opposite would be writing code that runs on a web browser which is known as front-end development.

In back-end programming, the primary concern is web servers, applications (written in one or more back-end languages) and databases. Our discussions and projects at the cluster stem from these areas.
