# Competitive Programming Cluster
Competitive programming (CP) is a sport usually carried out online, involving participants trying to solve a programming problem according to provided specifications. Majority of the problems appearing in CP are mathematical and logical in nature, belonging to categories such as data structures, combinatorics, string analysis, number theory, graph theory and geometry.

Our focus in this cluster is discussing and solving CP challenges, and preparing for/participating in programming competitions. Members are free to use whatever programming language they prefer.
